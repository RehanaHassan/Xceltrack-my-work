Risk Assessment
High Risk
: The project has focused heavily on UI/authentication but has not tackled the core technical challenges (Excel parsing, version control, collaboration)
Timeline Risk
: Implementing the missing 70-75% will require significant development time
Technical Complexity
: The remaining features are the most technically challenging parts of the project
📈
 Estimated Effort Remaining
Based on the SRS requirements and current state:
Completed
: 25-30% (~4-6 weeks of work)
Remaining
: 70-75% (~14-20 weeks of work)
Total Project Estimate
: 18-26 weeks (4.5-6.5 months) from start to completion
Current Position
: You are approximately 
1-1.5 months
 into the project timeline.
Conclusion
The 
XcelTrack
 project has established a 
strong foundation
 with authentication, admin features, and UI infrastructure. However, the 
core Excel version control functionality
—which is the entire purpose of the application—has not yet been started.
To complete the project successfully, the team needs to:
Shift focus to the core Excel processing and version control features
Implement the database schema to support cell-level tracking
Integrate Excel parsing libraries (
SheetJS
/
ExcelJS
)
Build the version control engine
Add real-time collaboration capabilities
Integrate AI features
The next 3-4 months will be critical
 for implementing these core features.
