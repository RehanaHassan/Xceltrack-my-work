Mock backend APIs initially, integrate later
Focus on user experience and responsiveness
For Member 2 (Backend):
Design database schema carefully upfront
Write migration scripts for easy schema updates
Test Excel parsing with various file formats
Optimize queries early to avoid performance issues later
For Member 3 (Admin/Integration):
Set up 
WebSocket
 server early for testing
Use AI API free tiers for development
Document integration points clearly
Be ready to help with integration issues
